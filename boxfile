# Self-deploying project! Cool!
# This is a very unusual deploy script
# It attempts to put Hooker into a specific place on the system, different from
# where the rest of the git code is stored
# 
# Everytime you push to its bare repo it rebuilds itself.
# Which means that if you break it, you will have to fix it manually
